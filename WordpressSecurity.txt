Keep WordPress Updated: Regularly update WordPress core, themes, and plugins to ensure you have the latest security patches and bug fixes.
Strong Admin Credentials: Use strong and unique passwords for your admin account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.
Limit Login Attempts: Implement a plugin or security measure that limits the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable two-factor authentication for WordPress logins. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second verification factor, such as a code generated on a mobile device.
Secure Hosting Environment: Choose a reputable hosting provider that emphasizes security, performs regular server updates, and employs security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Use SSL/TLS: Enable SSL/TLS encryption on your WordPress site to ensure secure communication between the server and visitors. This is particularly important for securing login credentials and sensitive data.
Disable File Editing: Prevent unauthorized access to your WordPress files by disabling the built-in file editor in the WordPress admin area.
Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF helps detect and block malicious traffic, including common attack patterns and known vulnerabilities.
Regular Backups: Create regular backups of your WordPress site, including the database and files. This allows you to restore your website in case of an attack or data loss.
Use Security Plugins: Install reputable security plugins that offer features like malware scanning, firewall protection, and vulnerability detection.
Strong User Permissions: Assign appropriate user roles and permissions to limit access and capabilities to only those who require them.
Monitor and Audit Logs: Implement a log monitoring system to track and review activity logs for any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
